# C++ Array Operations

This repository contains C++ programs that demonstrate various array operations. Each program focuses on a specific operation, providing clear examples for learning and reference.

## Programs:

### 1. Find Maximum Element in Array
- **File:** `find_max_element.cpp`
- **Overview:** This program takes user input to create an array, displays the entered elements, and finds the maximum element along with its index in the array.

### 2. Search for an Item in Array
- **File:** `search_item.cpp`
- **Overview:** This program prompts the user to input an array and an item to search. It then searches for the item in the array and prints the location (index) if found.

### 3. Combined Maximum Element and Search
- **File:** `combined_max_element_and_search.cpp`
- **Overview:** This program combines the functionalities of finding the maximum element and searching for an item in an array.

### 4. Array Operations Using Pointers
- **File:** `array_operations_with_pointers.cpp`
- **Overview:** This program showcases the use of pointers to find the maximum element in an array.

### 5. Array Operations Using Do-While Loops
- **File:** `array_operations_with_do_while.cpp`
- **Overview:** This program uses do-while loops for array input and finding the maximum element.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-array-operations.git`
2. Navigate to the desired program directory: `cd cpp-array-operations`
3. Compile the program: `g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name`
4. Run the executable: `./program_name`

Feel free to explore and use these programs to understand and practice array operations in C++. Contributions and improvements are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue.

Happy coding!
